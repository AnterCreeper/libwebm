Why the files in this directory are considered invalid:

chapters_truncated_chapter_string.mkv -
  File with a Chapters element that ends with a ChapterAtom whose ChapterDisplay
  element contains a truncated ChapterString.

chapters_truncated_chapter_string_2.mkv -
  Nearly identical to chapters_truncated_chapter_string.mkv, but with a void
  element and a partial cluster. Causes mkvparser to fail in a slightly
  different manner.

fixed_lacing_bad_lace_size.mkv -
  File containing a BlockGroup with fixed lacing, but reports a total laced size
  that is not evenly divisible by the number of laced frames.
